# University-of-Michigan-Applied-Machine-Learning-in-Python

## Description
This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. The course will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, will be tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis

## Files
Assignment+1.ipynb: For this assignment, we will be using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database to create a KNN classifier that can help diagnose patients.

Assignment+2.ipynb: In this assignment we'll explore the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models such as non-regularised polynomial linear regression, regularised Lasso polynomial linear regression, decision tree and support vector classifier

Assignment+3.ipynb: In this assignment we will train SVC and logistic regression model and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of credit card fraud. We will optimise hyperparameters using grid search.

Assignment+4.ipynb: Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. For this assignment, create a function that trains a model to predict blight ticket compliance in Detroit. We will be using XGBoost classifier
